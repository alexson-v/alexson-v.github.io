After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to IanRoko88 or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.</p><h2>Could my information be transferred to other countries?</h2><p>IanRoko88 is incorporated in Ukraine.

To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.</p><h2>Is the information collected through the IanRoko88 Service secure?</h2><p>We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.</p></div></div></section></main><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="footer__wrapper"><a href="index.html" class="footer__logo"><img src="img/logo.png" alt="Logo"> <span>IanRoko88</span></a><div class="footer__copyright">All rights reserved © 2024</div></div><div class="footer__wrapper"><a href="mailto:IanRoko88@takemybet.org" class="footer__email"><span>IanRoko88@takemybet.org</span> <img src="icons/email-icon.svg" alt="Company email"></a><nav class="footer__legal"><ul><li><a href="legal.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="#" target="_blank">Terms & Conditions</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="js/common.js"></script></body></html>
